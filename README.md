# Chess-Engine

This project is primary build on top of chess.js and chessboard.js. The project is a simple web app and supports both single and two player games.
The single player game is of intermdeiate difficulty and can be considered equivalent to a level 5 Chess Titans computer player. 

# The algorithm

It utilises the Min-Max algorithm to create a formidable chess opponent.In addition, it also utilises alpha-beta pruning to achieve better results to shorten the game tree.
The computer looks for moves upto a depth of 10 moves and decides upon best move to make.

# Platform

The project is purely a front-end task and requires no backend. It is a simple web app and can be used by all.
Enjoy!
